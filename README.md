## Overview
Airbnb is a global online marketplace that offers housing and other accommodations to travelers. The platform has grown significantly in popularity over the years, with millions of hosts and guests using the platform for their travel needs.

The aim of this project is to create a recommender system that will help stakeholders and clients have a better strategy in decision making. The system will also help stakeholders do proper renovations of their listings efficiently without inconveniencing their clients.

## Business Problem
A South-Africa based housing company wants to venture into the Airbnb business and needs to create a sustainable and profitable business model that can compete with established players in the market. The company's stakeholders aims at ensuring customer retention,customer satisfaction and boost their business as a new party entity in the Airbnb Platform. As Data Scientists, we are expected to address questions as well as provide recommendations.

Some of the questions we are expected to answer are:

1.What is the best month to visit Cape Town if you are on a budget?
2.What is the best time to list your property on Airbnb? And how do set price rates according to the time of the year?
3.What is the best time in the year when owners can take down their listing for maintenance and repair?
4.When is the best time to lure clients with offers in the case of an upcoming low season: Time series analysis

## Data
We extracted the data from InsideAirbnb which has data from the Airbnb platform. The link to the dataset is provided here: "http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/"

## Predictive Modelling
Our approach to building a predictive model will be to use a Content Based Filtering Recommendetion System, Sentiment Analysis
